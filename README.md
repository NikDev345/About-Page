🎭 Interactive Hover Reveal – React + Vite

An experimental React + Vite project that creates an immersive visual experience where background images dynamically reveal based on cursor movement.
The page reacts to the user’s presence — as the cursor moves, hidden layers emerge, creating a cinematic, psychological, and modern portfolio-style effect.

🚀 Live Concept

“The UI does not wait for the user — it responds to them.”

The background image is not static

Visibility changes based on cursor hover position

Designed to feel alive, reactive, and immersive

Ideal for portfolio landing pages, creative profiles, or experimental UI concepts

this is the best i can do for now 
as i dont have more time to execute the full program

🖱️ How It Works (Concept)

The cursor position is tracked using mouse events

Based on hover coordinates:

Background layers are revealed or masked

Visual focus shifts dynamically

The effect creates a parallax-like reveal without heavy libraries

This approach keeps performance high while delivering a next-gen interaction feel.
